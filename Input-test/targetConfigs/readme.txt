This is the test code for testing Inputs. 

Followings are the basic assumptions.

1. We have used UART7 as an debug port for hardware debugging. So all UARTPrint will be on UART7.
2. User will use push buttons to actuate any input.


Disclaimer:

This codes are not for production or mass use. The primary usage is limited to test the hardware and 
to debugg the circuit boards.
